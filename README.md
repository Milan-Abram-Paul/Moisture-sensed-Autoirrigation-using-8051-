# Moisture-sensed-Autoirrigation-using-8051-
This repository contains the code and circuit design for an automatic irrigation system based on 8051 microcontroller. The system uses a soil moisture sensor to monitor soil conditions and automatically activates a water pump when the moisture level drops below a predefined threshold.
